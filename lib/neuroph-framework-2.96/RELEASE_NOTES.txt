Neuroph 2.96 Release Notes

Neuroph 2.96 comes with various API improvements, several new features, more examples for standard introductory machine learning tasks, and 
initial implementation of Java Visual Recognition API JSR381.

API improvements are related to normalization methods, data set spliting/sampling, HE weight initialisation and kfold crossvalidation.
There are also inital implementations of new neural network architectures like implementation of ART and LSTM.

Samples project provides package org.neuroph.samples.standard10ml with examples of 10 standard machine learning problems 
which are suitable for teaching neural networks and machine learning basics with Java.

Also there are several contributions in Contrib project related to hyper parameter search and, backpropagation benchmarking, 
and cross entropy loss function which are still not fully tested and integrated.

This release also includes initial implementation of parts of Visual Recognition API, which is being developed as official 
Java technology Standard for Visual Recognition tasks within JCP (Java Community Process).

GitHub repository has also been reorganized so the framework and NeurophStudio GUI are now separate repositories.

With develpoment of a number of advanced deep learning framework with support for GPU and distributed computing, such as 
Tensorflow, PyTorch, Deeplearning4j and many others, the main purporse Of Neuroph is to be an entry level
and educational software to introduce Java developers to field of neural networks and deep learning.

At some universities it is being used as  first step to learn basic concepts and principles before moving to more advanced frameworks, 
thanks to interactive examples, visualizations, readable source code and user friendly IDE-like environment.

We're working on Neural Newtorks ExPLODE teaching methodology (EXploratory Programming and Learning Open Developemnt Environment)
which will provide set of tools, tutorials and teaching methodology that will be the fastest way for Java developers to learn neural networks/machine learning.


For existing Neuroph users who might need more advanced features and additional support we recommend to take a look at Deep Netts Platform https://deepnetts.com 
Deep Netts Platform is built on same philosophy as Neuroph to create intuitive easy-to-use neural network/deep learning environment for software developers,
and more advanced features and implementation. The future releases of Neuroph will include deep netts community edition, in order to 
provide better support for convolutional networks for image recognition.

And at the end, we want to announce the next release soon that will be based on Apache NetBeans 11, include support for
 Deep Netts Community Edition, and generic standard Java machine learning and visual recognition API which is being developed within JSR 381.

Many thanks to students from University of Belgrade, and other contributors and users all around the world who helped to build this release.
Note that if some of the contibutions are not present in this release we'll integrate them in some of the next releases.

Build learning/teaching materials based on neuroph


Even if you are usiing Tensorflow, for initial lessons, interactive examples and readable code within familiar IDE like environment
Our teaching practice shows that Neuroph is being used together as a complement in inital stages while explaining basic concepts, thanks to visualization, and friendly familiar environent

For users that would like to get more support and still have neuroph hpilosophy easy to use, integrate, import with handy gui
we would like to announce deveopment of DeepNetts Platform 

For existing users that look for more advanced festuresm while keeping developer experience and ease of use and integration with higgher level of support
we recommend to take a look at deep netts platform
And general java developer friendly workflow 

deep netts will be available soon (pre-register, ask for demo, demo video) estimated end of may

deep netts is based on lessons learned from building neuroph taking what is good, even better workflow, that allows fatser turnaround and experimentation,
with ide-like environment and usability, development experience
support for convolutional networks and more advanced features like and ocmmercial support

why was deep netts created:
	easy to understand and use while adding more advanced features
	keep neuroph suitable for learning and deep netts for
